## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **Node.js**
<br>
<br>
We used our newly acquired backend skills to create a full stack "Rock, Paper, Scissors" app, which handles inputs on both the client and server sides. 
The player's choice is run against a randomly generated computer choice, which display in the DOM in the form of animated images. The player is
alerted to whether they won, lost, or drew with the computer. 

## Lessons Learned:

Trying to write backend code without any assitance from frameworks is challenging, and leads to code that is not very "DRY." We hit a lot of snags with our
project, but managed to build an "mvp" that gets the job done. Teamwork makes the dream work!
